#To Conclude

**Implications**

Some possible implications from the trends in our data include:

- For-hire-vehicles provide efficient transportation for all users, therefore,
have become more popular.
- For-hire-vehicles are on the rise because there were never enough
taxi cabs to handle periods of peak demands.
- Taxi cabs have not done a sufficient job in keeping up to date with modern
user demands (for example: ordering a car quickly from a phone application)

**Limitations**

However, despite our visualizations suggesting an overarching trend and
correlations, we must keep in mind that our data could have several limitations

- For-hire-vehicles may be simply a much larger subset of cars.
  - For-hire-vehicles include Community Cars (aka Liveries), Black Cars,
    and Luxury Limousines. (the FHV industry is now predominantly app-based)
  - In New York, all for-hire-vehicles must have a TLC license, however,
    the sign up process for a license during the years in our data was easier.
  - Yellow Medallion Taxicabs are the official taxis of New York City. There
  are currently about 13,000 licensed taxicabs and they provide transportation
  for passengers via street hails. Drivers face a unique set of
  requirements in order to be licensed to drive a yellow taxicab.

- The Taxi and Limousine Commission published base trip record data as submitted
 by the bases. Therefore, we cannot guarantee or confirm the accuracy or
 completeness of the data.

 - Despite the visualizations displaying _correlation_, we cannot conclude that
 our data suggests _causation_. This is because despite the connection yellow
 between taxi's and for-hire-vehicles, we cannot say with confidence that
 one directly effects the other.

**Current Issues**

To help taxi's business in New York...
-City officials first attempted to pass a cap on the number of FHVs in **2015**,
as you can see from our data, the effort was unsuccessful at the time.
-Currently, a bill that will put a moratorium on the issuance of new licenses
for FHVs for one year, which is another reason why the data stops in June 2018

However...
Critics of the change, including FHV companies, argue that limiting the
number of FHVs will make it harder for New Yorkers, particularly those of color
and those living outside cab-saturated neighborhoods, to get around.

**Future Questions**

In the face of this growth of FHV, will yellow taxi's be driven out?

Should we fight to protect the yellow taxi's or should we embrace this
free-market revolution in transportation?
