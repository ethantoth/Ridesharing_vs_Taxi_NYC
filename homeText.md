### Our Purpose

As technology advances, industries have to change to fit the expansion of time, money or resources. When ridesharing
services were first introduced to San Francisco no one thought that the ability of being able
to call a cab from your phone would be the single feature that turned ridesharing services into a multi-billion dollar
industry. The exponential growth of this new service has gained popular media attention but has also remained somewhat
ambiguous when focus is drawn to its economical effects. By taking several high-volume data sets from the New York Taxi
and Limousine Commission we have derived three separate visualizations that illustrate the growth of ridesharing
services in New York City and the decline of more traditional services present in New York before a newer service was 
introduced.

### Visualizations

The visualizations on this application meant to show how different types of paid transport have
increased or decreased in popularity. Our data is filtered down to 2018 (the months of January to June)
and the first month of every year from 2015. The intent of these visualizations to speak to the current
debate surrounding lose of business for taxi drivers in urban areas, such as New York. The trends indicate that taxi use is slowly
on the decline, while in contrast, for-hire vehicle use is sturdily inclining. From this data it can be inferred that
for-hire vehicles (such as Uber or Lyft) are becoming more popular among consumers and with consequence taking away yellow
taxi's business.
